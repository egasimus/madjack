=================

In order of priority:

 - Add Jack Transport support

 - Write manpages for madjack and madjack-remote
 
 - resample audio that has different samplerate to jack
 
 - allow seeking to specific position?
 
 - more accurate converting of MAD's fixed numbers to 32bit floats ?
 
 - better checking of source of replies in OSC two way communication

 - make pause/play smoother (rapid fade?)
 
 - adjust playback speed/rate

 - simple GUI



 - Add support for other formats
   (libsndfile, CD Player?, Ogg Vorbis, FLAC...)
   and rename to Multiformat Audio Deck ?
