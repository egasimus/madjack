=================

In order of priority:

 - handle Interupt/Terminate signals
 
 - more accurate converting of MAD's fixed numbers to 32bit floats ?
 
 - calculate duration of tracks
 
 - allow seeking to specific points
 
 - adjust playback speed



Add support for other formats
  (libsndfile, Ogg Vorbis, FLAC...)
