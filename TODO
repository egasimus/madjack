=================

In order of priority:

 - mad.pc doesn't come with package sources (check for libary manually)
 
 - Change to use OSCQS style OSC messages

 - Manually connect JACK ports from command line of madjack
 
 - Write manpages for madjack and madjack-remote
 
 - more accurate converting of MAD's fixed numbers to 32bit floats ?
 
 - better checking of source of replies in OSC two way communication
 
 - calculate duration of tracks
 
 - allow seeking to specific points
 
 - allow changing of cue point
 
 - adjust playback speed



 - Add support for other formats
   (libsndfile, Ogg Vorbis, FLAC...)
