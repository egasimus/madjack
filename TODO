=================

In order of priority:
 
 - Sort out evil multiple control threads problem :(
     - problems with changing state at same time from
       different threads
       
 - Add Jack Transport support

 - Write manpages for madjack and madjack-remote
 
 - calculate duration of tracks
   (seconds = (bytes * 8) / bitrate / 10)
 
 - allow changing of cue point

 - allow seeking to specific position
 
 - more accurate converting of MAD's fixed numbers to 32bit floats ?
 
 - better checking of source of replies in OSC two way communication

 - make pause/play smoother (rapid fade?)
