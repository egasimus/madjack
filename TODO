MadJACK TODO List
=================

In order of priority:

 - make get_filepath return the full filepath
 
 - Run through profiling/check for memory leaks
 
 - Manually connect JACK ports from command line of madjack
 
 - Write manpages for madjack and madjack-remote
 
 - more accurate converting of MAD's fixed numbers to 32bit floats ?
 
 - better checking of source of replies in OSC two way communication
 
 - calculate duration of tracks
   (seconds	= (bytes * 8) / bitrate / 10)
 
 - allow seeking to specific points
 
 - allow changing of cue point
 
 - adjust playback speed
 
 - make pause/play smoother (rapid fade?)



 - Add support for other formats
   (libsndfile, Ogg Vorbis, FLAC...)
