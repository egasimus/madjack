MadJACK TODO List
=================

In order of priority:

 - Write manpages for madjack and madjack-remote
 
 - resample audio that has different samplerate to jack
 
 - adjust playback speed/rate

 - optimise QMadJACK class to send fewer OSC messages
     - cache calls to get_foo()
     - slow first timer down when not playing

 - make pause/play smoother (rapid fade?)
 
 - better checking of source of replies in OSC two way communication
 
 - Problem with (one channel) turning to static during plackback?
 
 - Make madjack close down properly when jackd goes away (in some cases)
 
 - Add Jack Transport support
 
 - more accurate converting of MAD's fixed numbers to 32bit floats ?



 - Add support for other formats
   (libsndfile, CD Player?, Ogg Vorbis, FLAC...)
   and rename to Multiformat Audio Deck ?
